# Spring_WebMVC_Redirect
A better option is using the prefix redirect: – the redirect view name is injected into the controller like any other logical view name. The controller is not even aware that redirection is happening.  When a view name is returned with the prefix redirect: – the UrlBasedViewResolver (and all its subclasses) will recognize this as a special indication that a redirect needs to happen. The rest of the view name will be used as the redirect URL.  A quick but important note here is that – when we use this logical view name here – redirect:/redirectedUrl – we’re doing a redirect relative to the current Servlet context.  We can use a name such as a redirect: http://localhost:8080/spring-redirect/redirectedUrl if we need to redirect to an absolute URL.
